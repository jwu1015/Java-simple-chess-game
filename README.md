# Java-simple-chess-game
In spring of 2023, I created a multiplayer chess game with checkmate/stalemate/check detection as a part of my highschool AP computer science class final project. The objective of the project was to create a game that implemented a design pattern, such as the model view controller used in this project.

The final product was free of bugs and a very accessible user interface, and ended up getting a 100% score based on both the teacher's careful examination, as well as extensive testing from other students in the class.
